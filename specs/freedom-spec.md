# Freedom Specification

**Version:** 0.1 — Draft\
**Status:** Normative draft\
**Depends on:** Effection 4.1-alpha (`createApi`, `createContext`,
`Signal`, `Stream`, `resource`, `spawn`, `Result`)

---

## 1. Purpose

Freedom ("free DOM") is a general-purpose abstract component
tree built on Effection's structured concurrency. It maintains
a tree of long-lived, stateful component nodes where each node
is an Effection resource with a scope, a property bag, and
ordered children.

The tree is a **bidirectional firehose**:

- **Input:** A synchronous `dispatch(event)` entry point
  accepts events of any shape at any rate.
- **Output:** A `Stream<void>` emits a notification after
  every mutation cycle, signaling renderers to walk the tree
  and rebuild output.

Freedom is renderer-agnostic. It has no opinion about what
properties mean, what events look like, or how output is
produced. Renderers, event vocabularies, and display systems
are consumers that operate on the tree from the outside.

---

## 2. Design Philosophy

### 2.1 Renderer independence

Freedom provides structure, state, events, and change
notification. It does not provide layout, rendering, styling,
or any visual vocabulary. A clayterm renderer reads
`node.props["clay"]`. A DOM renderer reads
`node.props["html"]`. Freedom does not know or care.

### 2.2 Event agnosticism

Freedom defines exactly one event operation:
`dispatch(event: unknown)`. It does not define keyboard
events, mouse events, or any other vocabulary. Applications
and framework layers install middleware at the root scope to
demux raw events into their own typed APIs. This allows
Freedom to serve DOM applications, terminal applications,
game engines, or any other event source without modification.

### 2.3 Operations over methods

Node mutations (`set`, `update`) and structural operations
(`append`, `remove`, `sort`) are Effection context API
operations, not methods on the Node object. This makes them
interceptable by middleware — a parent scope can wrap `set` to
validate, transform, log, or reject property changes in its
subtree. The component signature is `() => Operation<void>`;
everything is accessed through the ambient scope.

### 2.4 Orthogonal concerns

Identity, properties, and child ordering are fully
independent:

- **Identity** is intrinsic (object reference) with a
  framework-assigned unique `id` for external use.
- **Properties** are a JSON-like bag with conventional
  namespacing.
- **Ordering** is a separate axis: insertion order by default,
  or a custom sort function owned by the parent.

### 2.5 Immediate-mode output

The output stream emits `void` — a pure notification that
something changed. Renderers walk the tree and read properties
to produce output. This matches immediate-mode rendering
patterns (e.g., clayterm rebuilds `Op[]` every frame). The
JSON-like property constraint does not foreclose on richer
change records in the future.

### 2.6 Read-only Node surface

The `Node` object's data fields — `id`, `name`, `props`,
`children`, `parent` — are for reading only. All property
and structural mutations go through the `freedom:node`
context API, which makes every mutation interceptable by
middleware. `Node` also exposes `eval()` for scoped operation
execution and `remove()` for lifecycle management. `remove()`
is both a convenience method on `Node` and a context API
operation — the method delegates to the operation, ensuring
middleware always participates in teardown.

---

## 3. Terminology

**Tree.** The root resource that owns all component nodes.
Externally it is an event sink (`dispatch`) and a change
source (`Stream<void>`). Internally it is an Effection scope
that contains the root node, the event loop, and the
notification mechanism.

**Node.** A long-lived Effection resource within the tree.
Each node has a framework-assigned unique `id`, an optional
name, a property bag, an ordered list of children, and a
parent (except the root). A node's in-memory identity is its
object reference; its externalizable identity is its `id`.
The Node's data fields are read-only — all property mutations
go through the context API. Each node maintains an eval loop
that accepts operations via `node.eval()`, enabling scoped
execution. `node.remove()` delegates to the `remove` context
API operation, which halts the node's scope and tears down
all descendants. Middleware on `remove` participates in
teardown.

**Component.** A generator function of type
`() => Operation<void>` that runs within a node's Effection
scope for the node's entire lifetime. Components access node
operations and event middleware through the ambient scope.
A component either does its initialization work and returns,
or enters an infinite loop that reacts to changes. In either
case, the node remains alive — the node's scope outlives the
component generator.

**Property bag.** A `Record<string, JsonValue>` on each node.
Properties are the node's state AND its renderable
description — they are the same thing. Properties are
namespaced by convention (e.g., `"clay"`, `"aria"`).

**JsonValue.** The set of permissible property values:
`string | number | boolean | null | JsonValue[] | { [key: string]: JsonValue }`.
No `undefined`. Properties are removed with `unset()`.

**Dispatch.** The synchronous entry point for events.
`tree.dispatch(event)` pushes an event into the tree's
internal Signal. The event is then processed operationally
through middleware.

**Middleware.** An Effection `createApi` middleware function
that intercepts an operation. In Freedom, middleware is used
for both event handling (`dispatch.around(...)`) and property
mutation interception (`node.around(...)`).

**Demux.** Application-level middleware installed at the root
scope that routes raw `dispatch` events into typed,
application-specific APIs. Demuxing is NOT a Freedom concept —
it is a pattern that applications implement.

**Notification.** A `void` emission on the tree's output
stream indicating that the tree may have changed. At most one
notification is emitted per dispatch cycle. A dispatch cycle
that produces no property or structural changes MUST NOT emit
a notification.

---

## 4. JsonValue

### 4.1 Definition

```
JsonValue = string
          | number
          | boolean
          | null
          | JsonValue[]
          | { [key: string]: JsonValue }
```

### 4.2 Constraints

J1. `undefined` is NOT a valid JsonValue. Implementations
    MUST reject `undefined` in `set()` and `update()`.

J2. `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity` are NOT valid
    JsonValues. Implementations MUST reject them.

J3. Functions, symbols, class instances, `Date`, `Map`,
    `Set`, `RegExp`, and other non-JSON-serializable values
    are NOT valid JsonValues.

J4. Implementations SHOULD validate values at the `set()`
    and `update()` boundary. Invalid values MUST NOT be
    stored in the property bag.

### 4.3 Rationale

The JsonValue constraint ensures properties are:
- serializable (devtools, snapshots, undo/redo),
- structurally comparable (deep equality is well-defined),
- diffable (for future change record support).

Application-level state that requires richer types (functions,
class instances, Dates) belongs in the component's generator
scope as local variables, not in the property bag.

---

## 5. Node

### 5.1 Structure

Each node has:

- **id** (`string`) — a unique, framework-assigned identifier.
  Stable for the node's lifetime. Used by renderers and
  external systems to reference the node (e.g., clayterm
  named elements, ARIA ids, devtools).
- **name** (`string`, optional) — a human-readable label.
  Defaults to `""`. Not required to be unique. Used for
  debugging and optional lookup.
- **props** (`Record<string, JsonValue>`) — the property bag.
  Initially empty. Read-only; mutate via context API only.
- **children** (`Iterable<Node>`) — ordered child nodes.
  Initially empty. Read-only.
- **parent** (`Node | undefined`) — the parent node. The root
  node's parent is `undefined`. Read-only.

```ts
interface Node {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly props: Record<string, JsonValue>;
  readonly children: Iterable<Node>;
  readonly parent: Node | undefined;
  readonly data: NodeData;
  eval<T>(op: () => Operation<T>): Operation<Result<T>>;
  remove(): Operation<void>;
}
```

The Node's data fields are read-only. All property and
structural mutations go through the `freedom:node` context
API (§6). `eval` is a method on Node because it requires a
specific node reference. `remove` is both a method and a
context API operation — the method delegates to the
operation (§6.2), ensuring middleware participates in
teardown. `data` provides typed, symbol-keyed storage for
private, non-serializable per-node state (§5.7).

### 5.2 Identity

N1. A node's in-memory identity is its object reference. Two
    nodes are the same node if and only if they are the same
    object (`===`).

N2. Each node has a unique `id` string assigned by the
    framework at creation time. The `id` is immutable — it
    MUST NOT change for the node's lifetime. The `id` MUST
    be unique across all nodes in the tree at any given time.
    Two nodes are the same node if and only if
    `a.id === b.id`.

N3. The `id` is the externalizable identity. Renderers and
    external systems use it to correlate nodes across
    render cycles, reference nodes in output (e.g., named
    elements in clayterm), and track nodes in devtools.

N4. The format of `id` is implementation-defined. It MAY be
    a monotonic counter, a UUID, or any other scheme that
    guarantees uniqueness within the tree.

N5. Nodes are long-lived Effection resources. A node is
    created once and exists until explicitly removed or its
    parent scope exits.

N6. The `name` field is informational. It does NOT participate
    in identity, uniqueness, or reconciliation.

### 5.3 Scoped Evaluation

Each node maintains an **eval loop** — a spawned child task
within the node's scope that accepts and executes operations
submitted via `node.eval()`. The eval loop uses a channel-
based "fire and await" pattern: the caller submits an
operation and waits for its result; the eval loop executes
the operation in the node's scope and resolves the result.

N-eval1. `node.eval(op)` runs `op` within the node's
    Effection scope and returns `Result<T>`. If `op`
    completes successfully, the result is
    `{ ok: true, value: T }`. If `op` throws, the result
    is `{ ok: false, error }`.

N-eval2. Operations yielded inside `op` see the node's
    scope context — including all middleware installed in
    the node's scope and its ancestors.

N-eval3. The eval loop executes operations sequentially.
    If multiple callers submit operations concurrently,
    they are processed in order.

N-eval4. The eval loop is spawned as a child of the node's
    scope. It runs alongside the component and shares the
    same parent scope, so middleware installed by the
    component is visible to operations executed via `eval`.

### 5.4 Lifecycle

N7. A node is created by `append()`, which spawns a new
    Effection child scope within the parent node's scope and
    runs the component within it.

N8. A node is destroyed by `node.remove()`, which halts the
    node's spawned task. This triggers structured teardown
    of the component, the eval loop, all middleware installed
    in the scope, and all descendant nodes. `remove()` does
    not return until teardown is complete.

N9. When a node is destroyed, its middleware disappears
    automatically because the Effection scope is destroyed.

N10. When a parent node is destroyed, all child nodes are
     destroyed in reverse creation order (LIFO), per
     Effection's structured concurrency guarantees.

N11. `node.remove()` delegates to the `remove` context API
     operation (§6.2) via
     `yield* node.eval(() => remove(node))`. The `remove`
     operation runs inside the node's scope, and all
     middleware on `remove` participates in the teardown
     (outer to inner). The innermost implementation halts
     the scope from within. The method remains on `Node`
     for ergonomic use by parents:
     `yield* child.remove()`.

N12. Calling `remove()` on the root node is an error
     (C-rm3).

### 5.5 Property Bag

N13. Properties are accessed via `node.props`, which returns
     a read-only `Record<string, JsonValue>`. Implementations
     SHOULD return a frozen or proxied object to enforce
     read-only access at runtime.

N14. Properties MUST NOT be mutated by direct assignment to
     the `props` object. The ONLY way to modify properties is
     through the `freedom:node` context API operations (`set`,
     `update`, `unset`). See §6.

N15. The `props` object MUST reflect the latest state at all
     times. There is no staleness window.

N16. Properties are namespaced by convention. Top-level keys
     (e.g., `"clay"`, `"aria"`, `"app"`) serve as namespaces.
     Freedom does not enforce or validate namespaces.

### 5.6 Children and Ordering

N17. Children are ordered. The default ordering is
     **insertion order** — children appear in the order they
     were appended.

N18. A parent MAY install a **sort function** via the
     `sort` context API operation. When a sort function is
     active, iterating `node.children` applies the sort
     function to produce the ordering. Insertion order serves
     as tiebreaker for children that compare equal.

N19. A parent MAY clear the sort function via
     `sort(undefined)`, which reverts to insertion order.

N20. The sort function is applied at **read time** — when
     `node.children` is iterated. There is no eager
     re-sorting on property changes. The sort is always
     fresh because it runs against current property values
     at iteration time.

N21. Installing or clearing a sort function via `sort()`
     MUST emit a notification (§8), because the iteration
     order of children may have changed.

### 5.7 Node Data

Node data is typed, symbol-keyed storage for non-serializable,
private values associated with a node. It exists to give
extensions and middleware a place to store per-node state that
is invisible to other extensions, renderers, and application
code.

The property bag (§5.5) is the node's public, renderable
state — constrained to JsonValue, frozen, and observable via
notifications. Node data is the complement: private state
owned by a specific extension, unconstrained in type, and
invisible to the rest of the system. Only code holding the
key can read or write the data. All NodeData operations are
synchronous — no scope resolution is needed because the node
reference provides direct access to its data.

```ts
interface NodeDataKey<T> {
  readonly symbol: symbol;
  readonly defaultValue?: T;
}

interface NodeData {
  get<T>(key: NodeDataKey<T>): T | undefined;
  set<T>(key: NodeDataKey<T>, value: T): void;
  expect<T>(key: NodeDataKey<T>): T;
}

function createNodeData<T>(
  name: string,
  defaultValue?: T,
): NodeDataKey<T>;
```

D1. `createNodeData(name, defaultValue?)` creates a typed
    data key backed by a `Symbol(name)`. The symbol ensures
    true privacy — only code holding the key can access the
    data.

D2. `node.data.get(key)` returns the stored value, or
    `undefined` if no value was set.

D3. `node.data.set(key, value)` stores a value on the node
    under the given key.

D4. `node.data.expect(key)` returns the stored value, or
    `defaultValue` if no value was set. If neither exists,
    it throws an error.

D5. Node data does NOT trigger tree notifications. It is
    invisible to renderers.

The Node interface is extended:

```ts
interface Node {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly props: Record<string, JsonValue>;
  readonly children: Iterable<Node>;
  readonly parent: Node | undefined;
  readonly data: NodeData;
  eval<T>(op: () => Operation<T>): Operation<Result<T>>;
  remove(): Operation<void>;
}
```

---

## 6. Node Context API

### 6.1 API Definition

The node context API is an Effection API created with
`createApi`:

```
createApi("freedom:node", {
  *get(key: string): Operation<JsonValue | undefined>,
  *set(key: string, value: JsonValue): Operation<void>,
  *update(key: string, fn: (prev: JsonValue | undefined) => JsonValue): Operation<void>,
  *unset(key: string): Operation<void>,
  *append(name: string, component: Component): Operation<Node>,
  *remove(node: Node): Operation<void>,
  *sort(fn: ((a: Node, b: Node) => number) | undefined): Operation<void>,
})
```

Note: `node.remove()` is a convenience method that delegates
to the `remove` context API operation via
`yield* node.eval(() => remove(node))`. This ensures all
middleware on `remove` participates in teardown.

### 6.2 Operations

**get**

C-get1. `get(key)` returns the value of `key` in the current
    node's property bag, or `undefined` if the key does not
    exist.

C-get2. `get` is a `createApi` operation and can be
    intercepted by middleware. A parent MAY install middleware
    on `get` to transform, log, or virtualize property reads.

**set**

C1. `set(key, value)` stores `value` under `key` in the
    current node's property bag.

C2. `value` MUST be a valid JsonValue (§4). If not, the
    operation MUST raise an error.

C3. If `key` already exists, the previous value is replaced.

C4. `set` triggers a tree notification (§8).

**update**

C5. `update(key, fn)` calls `fn` with the current value of
    `key` (or `undefined` if the key does not exist) and
    stores the result.

C6. The return value of `fn` MUST be a valid JsonValue (§4).
    If not, the operation MUST raise an error.

C7. `update` triggers a tree notification (§8).

**unset**

C8. `unset(key)` removes `key` from the current node's
     property bag.

C9. If `key` does not exist, `unset` is a no-op. It MUST
     NOT raise an error.

C10. `unset` triggers a tree notification (§8) only if the
     key existed.

**append**

C11. `append(name, component)` creates a new child node with
     the given name, spawns an Effection child scope, and
     runs the component within it.

C12. `append` returns the newly created Node.

C13. `append` triggers a tree notification (§8).

C14. The child node's scope is a child of the current node's
     scope. Middleware installed in the child's scope inherits
     from the parent's scope per Effection's context
     prototype chain.

**sort**

C19. `sort(fn)` installs a sort function on the current
     node. When `fn` is defined, iterating this node's
     `children` applies `fn` to determine ordering. When
     `fn` is `undefined`, the sort function is cleared and
     ordering reverts to insertion order.

C20. `sort` triggers a tree notification (§8) (N19).

**remove**

C-rm1. `remove(node)` removes the given node. The innermost
     (default) implementation halts the node's scope from
     within, triggering structured teardown of the component,
     the eval loop, all middleware installed in the scope, and
     all descendant nodes. The halt mechanism lives inside the
     scope (e.g., a resolver the suspended task awaits) — the
     node does not hold a reference to its task.

C-rm2. `remove(node)` is a `createApi` operation and can be
     intercepted by middleware. Extensions (e.g., focus) MAY
     install middleware on `remove` to perform cleanup before
     the node is destroyed.

C-rm3. `remove(node)` on the root node is an error.

C-rm4. `remove` triggers a tree notification (§8).

### 6.3 Middleware Interception

C21. Because `get`, `set`, `update`, `unset`, `append`,
     `remove`, and `sort` are `createApi` operations, they can
     be intercepted by middleware installed in ancestor scopes.

C22. A parent component MAY install middleware on
     `freedom:node` to validate, transform, log, or reject
     property changes in its subtree.

C23. Middleware on `set` receives the `[key, value]` tuple
     and a `next` function. It MAY modify the key or value
     before calling `next`, or it MAY skip `next` to reject
     the mutation.

---

## 7. Event Dispatch

### 7.1 The Dispatch API

Freedom provides a dispatch API with event dispatch and
node lookup:

```
createApi("freedom:dispatch", {
  *dispatch(event: unknown): Operation<Result<true>> {
    return { ok: false };
  },
  *getNodeById(id: string): Operation<Node | undefined>,
})
```

E1. The `dispatch` operation accepts a single argument of
    type `unknown`. Freedom does not constrain, inspect, or
    interpret the event in any way.

E2. The default handler (at the bottom of the middleware
    chain) returns `{ ok: false }`, indicating the event was
    unhandled.

E3. Middleware that handles an event MUST return
    `{ ok: true, value: true }`.

E4. If middleware throws an exception, the result MUST
    capture it as `{ ok: false, error }`. The dispatch loop
    MUST NOT crash. The tree MUST remain alive.

E4a. `getNodeById(id)` returns the node with the given `id`,
     or `undefined` if no such node exists. This allows
     dispatch middleware to resolve event targets by id and
     use `node.eval()` to dispatch application-level APIs
     in the target node's scope.

### 7.2 The Synchronous Bridge

E5. `tree.dispatch(event)` is synchronous. It pushes the
    event into an Effection `Signal`.

E6. Internally, an event loop reads from the Signal and
    dispatches each event through the root node's scope:
    `yield* root.eval(() => dispatch.operations.dispatch(event))`.
    The event loop itself MAY run anywhere — it enters the
    root node's scope via `eval`, so dispatch middleware
    installed by the root component is always in the chain.

E7. Events are processed sequentially — one at a time, in
    the order they were dispatched. A new event is not
    processed until the previous event's entire middleware
    chain has completed.

### 7.3 Demuxing

E8. Freedom does NOT provide built-in demuxing. It does not
    define event types, event shapes, or event routing.

E9. Demuxing is the root component's responsibility. The
    root component installs middleware on `freedom:dispatch`
    that routes events to application-specific APIs.

E10. The root component is the first component to run, so
     its middleware is the outermost layer — it sees every
     event before any child middleware.

E10a. Dispatch middleware uses `getNodeById()` and
     `node.eval()` to route events to specific nodes.
     When an event targets a particular node, the middleware
     resolves the node by id, then uses `eval` to invoke
     an application-level API in that node's scope. The
     target node's middleware on that application API
     participates because `eval` runs in the node's scope.

     ```ts
     // Example demux middleware (application-level, NOT Freedom)
     yield* DispatchApi.around({
       *dispatch([event], next) {
         if (isKeydown(event)) {
           let node = yield* DispatchApi.operations.getNodeById(event.targetId);
           if (node) {
             yield* node.eval(() => KeyboardApi.operations.keydown(event));
           }
           return { ok: true, value: true };
         }
         return yield* next(event);
       },
     });
     ```

E11. Applications define their own event APIs using
     `createApi`. These are NOT part of Freedom.

E12. Multiple demux layers MAY compose. A root breaks raw
     events into `keyboard`/`mouse` APIs. A child further
     breaks `keyboard` into `shortcut` based on key bindings.
     Each layer is middleware on an API.

### 7.4 Event Helpers

E13. Per-event-type helper functions are an application-level
     pattern, NOT part of Freedom. They are the sanctioned way
     for applications and framework layers to build ergonomic
     event APIs on top of Freedom's generic `dispatch` +
     `around()`.

A helper wraps the raw `around()` API to hide the tuple
destructuring and provide TypeScript type narrowing:

```ts
// Definition (in the app's event layer, NOT in Freedom)
function onkeydown(
  handler: (
    event: KeydownEvent,
    next: (event: KeydownEvent) => Operation<void>,
  ) => Operation<void>,
): Operation<void> {
  return keyboard.around({
    *keydown([event], next) {
      return yield* handler(event, (e) => next(e));
    },
  });
}

// Usage in a component
function* searchBox(): Operation<void> {
  yield* set("query", "");

  yield* onkeydown(function* (event, next) {
    if (event.key === "Enter") {
      yield* update("query", () => event.text);
    } else {
      yield* next(event);
    }
  });
}
```

The helper is better than raw middleware because:
- The consumer sees `(event, next)` instead of `([event], next)`.
- TypeScript narrows `event` to `KeydownEvent` automatically.
- The `keyboard` API reference is encapsulated — the consumer
  does not need to know which API object to call `around()` on.

## 8. Tree and Notification

### 8.1 Tree Interface

```
interface Tree extends Stream<void, never> {
  dispatch(event: unknown): void;
  root: Node;
}
```

T1. The tree is an Effection resource. Creating it starts a
    root Effection scope that owns all nodes and the event
    loop.

T2. `tree.root` is the root node. It is created when the
    tree is created and exists for the tree's lifetime.

T3. `tree.dispatch(event)` is the synchronous event entry
    point (§7.2).

T4. The tree is a `Stream<void, never>`. Subscribing to the
    stream yields notifications when the tree changes.

### 8.2 Creation

T5. `createTree(root: Component): Operation<Tree>` creates
    a tree. It:
    1. Creates the root Effection scope.
    2. Creates the event Signal.
    3. Creates the root node.
    4. Runs the root component within the root node's scope.
    5. Spawns the event loop, which dispatches events through
       the root node via `root.eval()`.
    6. Returns the Tree.

T6. `createTree` returns once the root node's eval loop is
    ready to accept operations. The root component runs
    concurrently within the root node's scope — it MAY
    still be executing when `createTree` returns. The tree
    is usable as soon as `eval` is operational.

### 8.3 Notification

T7. The tree emits a `void` notification on its output
    stream after each dispatch cycle — that is, after one
    event has been fully processed through the middleware
    chain and all resulting property mutations and
    structural changes have settled.

T8. A dispatch cycle that produces no property changes,
    structural changes, or sort function changes MUST NOT
    emit a notification.

T9. Multiple property mutations within a single dispatch
    cycle MUST coalesce into a single notification. The
    renderer sees the final state, never intermediate states.

T10. Structural changes (append, remove) and sort changes
     within a dispatch cycle also coalesce with property
     changes into a single notification.

T11. Property mutations or structural changes that occur
     outside of a dispatch cycle (e.g., during component
     initialization) MUST also emit notifications.

T12. The notification is `void`. It carries no information
     about what changed. The renderer MUST walk the tree and
     read properties to determine the current state.

### 8.4 Lifecycle

T13. Destroying the tree (exiting its Effection scope)
     destroys all nodes, stops the event loop, and closes
     the output stream.

T14. Events dispatched after the tree is destroyed are
     silently dropped. This is a natural consequence of
     structured concurrency — the event Signal is inert
     once the tree's scope exits. Implementations do NOT
     need an explicit alive check.

## 9. Component

### 9.1 Signature

```
type Component = () => Operation<void>;
```

P1. A component is a generator function that takes no
    arguments and returns `Operation<void>`.

P2. A component runs within a node's Effection scope. It
    accesses node operations and event middleware through
    the ambient scope via `createApi` operations.

P3. A component's lifetime is the node's lifetime. When the
    node is removed, the component's operation is cancelled
    per Effection's structured concurrency.

### 9.2 Execution Model

P4. The node's scope outlives the component generator. When
    the generator returns, the node remains alive — the
    eval loop (§5.3) keeps the scope active, properties
    persist, and middleware remains active.

P5. A component takes one of two forms:

    **Initialization-only:** The component sets properties,
    installs middleware, appends children, and returns. The
    node lives on via its eval loop.

    ```ts
    function* header(): Operation<void> {
      yield* set("clay", { type: "element", bg: 0xFF0000 });
      yield* set("label", "Hello");
      yield* append("subtitle", subtitle);
    }
    ```

    **Reactive:** The component spawns a long-lived task
    that reacts to changes over time, then returns.

    ```ts
    function* clock(): Operation<void> {
      yield* spawn(function* () {
        let i = 0;
        while (true) {
          yield* set("tick", i++);
          yield* sleep(1000);
        }
      });
    }
    ```

    A component MAY also run an infinite loop inline,
    but this blocks the component body from returning.
    The eval loop and the component run concurrently
    regardless.

P6. Steps within a component (setting properties, installing
    middleware, appending children) complete in order. This
    means middleware and children are established before the
    component enters a reactive loop or returns.

---

## 10. Invariants

I1. **Scope-tree correspondence.** The node tree and the
    Effection scope tree are isomorphic. Each node's scope
    is a child of its parent node's scope.

I2. **Structured teardown.** Removing a node destroys all
    its descendants in reverse creation order. No orphaned
    nodes can exist.

I3. **Middleware scope binding.** Middleware installed in a
    node's scope is active only while that node exists. When
    the node is removed, its middleware is automatically
    removed.

I4. **Sequential dispatch.** Events are processed one at a
    time. No two events are in-flight simultaneously.

I5. **Consistent notification.** The tree state visible to a
    renderer after a notification is complete and consistent
    — all mutations from the triggering dispatch cycle have
    been applied.

I6. **Property validity.** Every value in every node's
    property bag is a valid JsonValue at all times.

I7. **Ordering consistency.** `node.children` always reflects
    the current ordering — either insertion order or the
    sort function applied at read time against current
    property values.

I8. **Node read-only plus methods.** The Node object's data
    fields (`id`, `name`, `props`, `children`, `parent`) are
    read-only. All property reads and mutations go through the
    `freedom:node` context API (`get`, `set`, `update`,
    `unset`, `append`, `remove`, `sort`). `eval()` provides
    scoped operation execution. `remove()` is both a
    convenience method and a context API operation — the
    method delegates to the operation.

## 11. Deferred Extensions

The following are explicitly out of scope for this version.

### 11.1 Rich Change Records

The output stream emits `void`. A future version MAY emit
structured change records (`PropertyChange`,
`StructuralChange`) with per-node, per-property granularity.
The JsonValue constraint and property bag structure are
designed to support this without API changes.

### 11.2 JSX Transform

A JSX transform that provides declarative sugar for
`append()` calls is a natural extension. Display properties
would be set separately by each component via the context
API. JSX is a consumer of Freedom's imperative API, not a
core feature.

### 11.3 Reconciliation

Key-based reconciliation (matching old nodes to new
declarations during declarative re-rendering) is not
supported. Nodes are managed imperatively via `append` and
`remove`. A reconciliation layer could be built on top of
Freedom.

### 11.4 Computed Properties

Derived properties that update automatically when their
dependencies change are not supported. Components can
implement this pattern manually by installing middleware
on `set`.

### 11.5 Node Queries

Querying the tree by property values, name patterns, or
other criteria is not provided. `getNodeById()` is provided
as part of the dispatch API (§7.1) for event targeting.
For other queries, consumers walk the tree via `root` and
`children`.

### 11.6 Event Bubbling / Capturing

Freedom does not define event propagation phases. Middleware
composition through the scope tree provides a similar
capability, but the traversal order is determined by
middleware installation order, not by a DOM-style
capture/bubble model.

### 11.7 Explicit Index Ordering

A built-in ordering mode based on an `index` property is
not provided. If an application wants index-based ordering,
it sets an `index` property on child nodes and provides a
sort function that reads it.

## 12. Implementation Files

**`lib/types.ts`** — `JsonValue`, `Component`, `Node`
interface, `Tree` interface.

**`lib/tree.ts`** — `createTree(root: Component)`. Root
scope, event Signal, output stream, event loop, notification
coalescing.

**`lib/node.ts`** — Node resource. Child scope, property bag,
children list with read-time sort.

**`lib/dispatch.ts`** — `createApi("freedom:dispatch", ...)`.
`dispatch(event: unknown) → Result<true>` and
`getNodeById(id: string) → Node | undefined`.
Sync→operational bridge via Signal.

**`lib/freedom.ts`** — `createApi("freedom:node", ...)`.

## 13. Dependencies

Freedom depends on Effection 4.1-alpha for:

- `createApi` — context-scoped API with middleware
- `createContext` — scoped state
- `Signal` — synchronous write, operational read
- `Stream` — async iteration protocol
- `resource` — long-lived scoped values
- `spawn` — concurrent child tasks
- `Result` — success/failure envelope
- `Operation` — the base computation type
