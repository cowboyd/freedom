# Freedom — Conformance Test Plan

**Tests:** Freedom Specification

---

## 1. Test Plan Scope

### 1.1 What This Plan Covers

This test plan defines conformance criteria for the Freedom
component tree as specified in the Freedom Specification. It
covers:

- JsonValue validation at the `set`/`update` boundary (§4)
- Node lifecycle: creation via `append`, destruction via
  `remove`, structured teardown (§5.3)
- Node identity: unique `id` assignment (§5.2)
- Property bag: `set`, `update`, `unset` operations (§6.2)
- Property bag read-only enforcement (§5.4)
- Child ordering: insertion order, custom sort at read time
  (§5.5)
- Sort installation/removal notification (N19)
- Node context API middleware interception (§6.3)
- Event dispatch: single API, `Result<true>` signaling,
  error capture (§7.1)
- Synchronous bridge: Signal-based dispatch, sequential
  processing (§7.2)
- Tree creation and lifecycle (§8.2, §8.4)
- Notification coalescing, including no-change suppression
  (§8.3)
- Component execution model (§9)
- All invariants (§10)

### 1.2 What This Plan Does Not Cover

- JSX transforms (§11.2)
- Reconciliation (§11.3)
- Computed properties (§11.4)
- Node queries (§11.5)
- Event bubbling/capturing (§11.6)
- Explicit index ordering (§11.7)
- Rich change records (§11.1)
- Application-level demux patterns (§7.3) — these are
  tested in application test suites, not Freedom's
- Event helper functions (§7.4) — application-level pattern

### 1.3 Tiers

**Core:** Tests that every conforming implementation MUST
pass. A Freedom implementation is non-conforming if any Core
test fails.

**Extended:** Tests for edge cases, boundary conditions, and
robustness. Recommended but not strictly required.

## 2. JsonValue Validation

### 2.1 Core: Valid Values

JV1. `set("k", "hello")` — string accepted.
JV2. `set("k", 42)` — number accepted.
JV3. `set("k", 0)` — zero accepted.
JV4. `set("k", -1.5)` — negative float accepted.

JV19. `set("k", new Date())` — MUST raise error (J3).
JV20. `set("k", new Map())` — MUST raise error (J3).

### 2.3 Core: update() Validation

JV21. `update("k", () => undefined)` — MUST raise error.
      The return value of the update function is validated.
JV22. `update("k", () => NaN)` — MUST raise error.
JV23. `update("k", () => 42)` — accepted.

---

## 3. Node Lifecycle

### 3.1 Core: Creation

NL1. `append("child", component)` creates a child node.
     The returned node has `name === "child"`.
NL2. The child appears in `parent.children`.
NL3. The child's `parent` is the appending node.
NL4. The child's `props` is initially empty (`{}`).
NL5. The child's component runs within the child's scope.
NL6. Multiple children can be appended to the same parent.

### 3.2 Core: Node ID

NL7. Each created node has a non-empty `id` string (N2).
NL8. Two sibling nodes have different `id` values (N2).
NL9. A node's `id` does not change after creation (N2).
NL10. Nodes in different subtrees have different `id`
      values (N2 — unique across the tree).
NL11. The root node has an `id`.

### 3.3 Core: Destruction

NL12. `remove()` destroys the node. The node no longer
      appears in its parent's `children`.
NL13. `remove()` on a node with children destroys all
      descendants.
NL14. Descendant destruction occurs in reverse creation order
      (LIFO).
NL15. After `remove()`, middleware installed by the node's
      component is no longer active.
NL16. `remove()` on the root node MUST raise an error (C18).

### 3.4 Extended: Edge Cases

NL17. Appending to a node that is being removed — behavior
      is implementation-defined but MUST NOT corrupt the tree.
NL18. A component that returns immediately (no loop) —
      the node remains alive (P4).

---

## 4. Property Bag

### 4.1 Core: set

PB1. `set("a", 1)` — `node.props["a"]` is `1`.
PB2. `set("a", 1)` then `set("a", 2)` — `node.props["a"]`
     is `2`.
PB3. `set("a", 1)` then `set("b", 2)` — both keys present.
PB4. `set("ns", { x: 1, y: 2 })` — namespaced object stored.
PB5. `node.props` reflects the update immediately after
     `set` completes (N13).

### 4.2 Core: update

PB6. `set("n", 1)` then `update("n", (v) => v + 1)` —
     `node.props["n"]` is `2`.
PB7. `update("missing", (v) => v ?? 0)` — `fn` receives
     `undefined`, stores `0`.
PB8. `update` is atomic: `node.props` reflects the new
     value after `update` completes.

### 4.3 Core: unset

PB9. `set("a", 1)` then `unset("a")` — `"a"` is no longer
     in `node.props`.
PB10. `unset("nonexistent")` — no error, no notification
      (C9, C10).

### 4.4 Core: Read-Only Enforcement

PB11. Direct assignment to `node.props["x"] = 1` MUST NOT
      modify the property bag OR MUST throw (N12).
      Implementations SHOULD freeze or proxy `props`.

---

## 5. Child Ordering

### 5.1 Core: Insertion Order

CO1. Append A, B, C. `children` yields A, B, C.
CO2. Append A, B, C. Remove B. `children` yields A, C.
CO3. Append A, B. Remove A. `children` yields B.

### 5.2 Core: Custom Sort

CO4. Set sort function `(a, b) => cmp(a.props.priority, b.props.priority)`.
     Append A (priority=3), B (priority=1), C (priority=2).
     `children` yields B, C, A.
CO5. With active sort, change B's priority from 1 to 10.
     Next iteration of `children` yields C, A, B (sort
     applied at read time, N18).
CO6. Clear sort function via `sort(undefined)`. `children`
     reverts to insertion order: A, B, C.

### 5.3 Core: Sort Notification

CO7. Install a sort function. Stream emits notification
     (N19, C20).
CO8. Clear a sort function. Stream emits notification
     (N19, C20).

### 5.4 Extended: Sort Edge Cases

CO9. Sort function that throws — behavior is
     implementation-defined but MUST NOT corrupt the
     children list.
CO10. Sort with equal comparisons — insertion order is
      the tiebreaker (N16).

## 5b. useNode Operation

### 5b.1 Core: Node Resolution

UN1. `useNode()` in the root component returns the root node.
     `node === tree.root`.

UN2. `useNode()` inside a child component returns the child
     node. `node.name` matches the child's name and
     `node !== tree.root`.

UN3. `useNode()` via `node.eval()` returns the eval target
     node.

### 5b.2 Core: Middleware Interception

UN4. Parent installs middleware on `useNode`. Child calls
     `useNode()`. Parent middleware intercepts and may
     substitute a different node reference.

---

## 6. Node Context API Middleware

### 6.1 Core: Interception

MW1. Parent installs middleware on `set`. Child calls
     `set("x", 1)`. Parent middleware receives `["x", 1]`
     and `next`. Parent calls `next("x", 1)`.
     `child.props["x"]` is `1`.

MW2. Parent middleware transforms: receives `["x", 1]`,
     calls `next("x", 2)`. `child.props["x"]` is `2`.

MW3. Parent middleware rejects: receives `["x", 1]`, does
     NOT call `next`. `child.props["x"]` is unchanged.

MW4. Middleware on `update` receives the `[key, fn]` tuple.

MW5. Middleware on `append` can intercept child creation.

MW6. Middleware on `sort` can intercept sort installation.

### 6.2 Core: Scope Isolation

MW7. Middleware installed in node A's scope does NOT
     intercept operations in node A's sibling B.

MW8. Middleware installed in a parent's scope intercepts
     operations in all descendants (scope inheritance).

MW9. After `remove()` on a node, its middleware is inactive.
     Subsequent operations in sibling nodes are not affected.

---

## 7. Event Dispatch

### 7.1 Core: Basic Dispatch

ED1. Dispatch an event. Root middleware receives it.
     Returns `{ ok: true, value: true }`. Result indicates
     handled.

ED2. Dispatch an event with no middleware installed beyond
     the default handler. Result is `{ ok: false }` —
     unhandled.

ED3. Dispatch two events sequentially. Each is processed
     in order. The second event's middleware sees state
     changes from the first.

### 7.2 Core: Error Capture

ED4. Middleware throws an exception. Result is
     `{ ok: false, error }`. The tree is still alive.
     Subsequent dispatches work normally.

ED5. Middleware throws in a child scope. The error is
     captured. The child node is NOT destroyed (the dispatch
     loop catches the error, the scope survives).

### 7.3 Core: Middleware Composition

ED6. Root installs dispatch middleware. Child installs
     dispatch middleware. Event flows through root
     middleware first (outermost), then child middleware.

ED7. Root middleware can short-circuit by not calling `next`.
     Child middleware never sees the event.

ED8. Child middleware handles an event (returns handled
     result). Root middleware's `next` receives the child's
     result.

### 7.4 Core: Sequential Processing

ED9. Dispatch event A, then event B while A is still
     processing. B is queued. B is processed after A
     completes.

ED10. Within one dispatch cycle, all property mutations are
      visible to subsequent middleware in the same chain.

---

## 8. Tree and Notification

### 8.1 Core: Creation

TN1. `createTree(root)` returns a Tree. `tree.root` is a
     Node. `tree.root.parent` is `undefined`.

TN2. The root component runs before `createTree` returns
     (T6). Properties set during initialization are
     visible on `tree.root.props`.

TN3. Middleware installed by the root component during
     initialization is active for the first dispatched
     event.

### 8.2 Core: Notification Stream

TN4. Subscribe to tree stream. Call `set` on any node.
     Stream emits `void`.

TN5. Subscribe to tree stream. Call `append`. Stream emits
     `void`.

TN6. Subscribe to tree stream. Call `remove`. Stream emits
     `void`.

TN7. Within one dispatch cycle, call `set` three times on
     different nodes. Stream emits exactly ONE `void`
     (coalescing, T9).

TN8. Within one dispatch cycle, call `set` and `append`.
     Stream emits exactly ONE `void` (T10).

TN9. Dispatch an event whose middleware makes no property or
     structural changes. Stream MUST NOT emit (T8).

### 8.3 Core: Initialization Notification

TN10. Root component calls `set` during initialization
      (before any dispatch). Stream emits a notification
      (T11).

### 8.4 Core: Lifecycle

TN11. Destroy the tree (exit its Effection scope). The
      output stream closes.

TN12. Dispatch an event after the tree is destroyed.
      No error, no effect (T14).

---

## 9. Component

### 9.1 Core: Execution

CP1. A component's generator runs when the node is created.

CP2. A component that returns without looping — the node
     remains alive (P4). Properties set during execution
     persist. Middleware installed during execution remains
     active.

CP3. A component in an infinite loop continues reacting
     until the node is removed.

CP4. A component can set properties, install middleware, and
     append children before returning or entering a loop (P6).

### 9.2 Core: Cancellation

CP5. When a node is removed, the component's operation is
     cancelled. `finally` blocks in the component run
     (Effection structured concurrency).

---

## 10. Invariant Verification

### 10.1 Core

IV1. After any sequence of operations, the node tree and
     scope tree are isomorphic (I1). Verify by walking both
     trees and comparing structure.

IV2. After removing a subtree, no orphaned nodes exist (I2).
     Verify that removed nodes do not appear in any
     `children` iteration.

IV3. After removing a node, its middleware is inactive (I3).
     Verify by dispatching an event and confirming the
     removed node's middleware is not called.

IV4. Two concurrent dispatches do not interleave (I4).
     Verify by dispatching two events that each set a
     property, and confirming the final state reflects
     sequential execution.

IV5. After a notification, `node.props` and `node.children`
     reflect the final state of all mutations from the
     triggering cycle (I5).

IV6. No invalid JsonValue can exist in any node's property
     bag at any time (I6).

IV7. Node fields are read-only (I8). Direct mutation of
     `id`, `name`, `props`, `children`, or `parent` is
     rejected or has no effect.

---

## 11. Explicit Non-Tests

The following scenarios are explicitly NOT tested because
they correspond to deferred extensions (§11 of the spec):

NT1. JSX transform producing `append` calls.
NT2. Key-based reconciliation of children.
NT3. Computed/derived properties.
NT4. Tree query operations.
NT5. DOM-style event bubbling or capturing phases.
NT6. Structured change records on the output stream.
NT7. Application-level demux middleware (tested by apps).
NT8. Event helper functions like `onkeydown` (app-level).
NT9. Explicit index ordering mode.
