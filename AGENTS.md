## Effection patterns

- Never use `sleep(0)` for synchronization. If you need to coordinate
  between tasks, use `withResolvers()` from Effection.

- Structured concurrency handles cleanup. Do not add explicit "alive"
  guards, flags, or checks for whether a scope has been destroyed.
  When a scope exits, its signals are inert and its tasks are halted.

- Do not reimplement middleware. If the spec says `createApi`, use
  `createApi` and its `around()` method. Do not maintain a parallel
  list of handlers.

- When delegating `[Symbol.iterator]`, bind directly:
  `[Symbol.iterator]: source[Symbol.iterator]` — not a wrapper
  generator.

- Effection methods are pre-bound. Do not use `.bind()` when
  assigning them — just assign directly: `child.remove = task.halt`.

## Naming conventions

- API interfaces are named for the domain: `Freedom`, `Dispatch`.
- API constants are the interface name suffixed with `Api`:
  `FreedomApi`, `DispatchApi`.
- Always export both the interface and the API constant.
- Effection resources use the `useX()` naming convention, not
  `createX()`. For example: `useTree()`, not `createTree()`.

## State

- Do not use module-level mutable state (counters, maps, etc.).
  Scope state to the resource or tree that owns it.

## Testing

- Tests should not need to know internal IDs. If a test needs a
  node reference, get it from the tree structure or from the return
  value of `append`.
- Use `node.eval()` to run operations in a node's scope from tests.
  Do not rely on component bodies having run by the time `createTree`
  returns.
